RShiny Script Example:
- 
- Here is an example of R script with an ability to make a Rshiny Webapp to play around with the plots and download them.
- Please download all files and have them in a working directory before you start running the code.
- Begin by running the analysis called "example.R"
- Then, with the populated environments, run the 'shiny.R' script to create a webapp from the results.

Note:
-
- The RShiny webapp will only work if the environments from 'example.R' are ran first.
- You have the option to expand the window to open in your chosen browser.
- Make sure all connections make sense and your working direcctory are changed to reflect your own working directoy.
