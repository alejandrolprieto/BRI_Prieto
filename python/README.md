Python Script Example:
-
- I created this script originally for a tutorial in 2024.
- This is some basic cartographic tools that maps out California.
- Please import everything into a work directory since it uses the files in the .zip folder.
- For this, I used Jupyter Notebooks within Anaconda Navigator to open/run the script.
