R Script Example:
-
- Here is an R porject meant to display some things I've done with R and the type of analysis I'm used to.
- There are more examples but in this case, it's displaying largescale patterns of Mytilidae (Family of Bivalvia, aka "Mussels") investigating it's Biogeography and Macroecolgy.
- This works best if you have these same folder (with its contents) in the same working directory.
