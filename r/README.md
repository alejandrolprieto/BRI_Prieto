R Script Example:
-
- Here is an R project meant to display some methods and analysis I've done with R. 
- In this example, we're taking a look at Mytilidae (Family of Bivalvia, aka "Mussels") by grabbing data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org).
- We start by cleaning the data, inspecting the data for biases, plotting the data on Maps (along with a subsampling technique), then finally plotting statistcal models of the dataset. 
- This works best if you have these same folder (with its contents) in the same working directory.


Important Note:
-
1. Be sure to install all packages listed.
2. Be sure to change working directory to match the one you're working in.
3. Run scripts in chronological order ( '0.', '1.0' then '2.0').
