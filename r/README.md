R Script Example:
-
- Here is an R project meant to display some methods and analysis I've done with R. 
- In this example, we're taking a look at Mytilidae (Family of Bivalvia, aka "Mussels") by grabbing data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org).
- We start by cleaning the data, inspecting the data for biases, plotting the data on Maps (along with a subsampling technique), then finally plotting statistcal models of the dataset. 
- This works best if you have these same folder (with its contents) in the same working directory.
- Be sure to install all packages listed.
- If this is done, then the code should be able to run hands-free.
- Start with script labeled '0.' then follow numerically to '2.0'.
