R Script Example:
-
- Here is an R porject meant to display some things I've done with R and the type of analysis I'm used to.
- There are more examples but in this example, we're taking a lookat  Mytilidae (Family of Bivalvia, aka "Mussels") by grabbing data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org).
- We start by cleaning the data, inspecting the data for biases, then plotting the data on Maps (along with a subsampling technique), then finnaly plotting statistcal models of the dataset. 
- This works best if you have these same folder (with its contents) in the same working directory.
- Be sure to install all packages listed.
