Here, you'll find all my examples of maps I've made using ArcGIS/ArcPro

StoryMap:
-
- Here is a StoryMap I contributed to during my time as an undergraduate at St. John's University (2014 - 2018)
- I collected data with other students, updated previous maps and edited the StoryMap.
- I've know about ESRI products since 2015 and StoryMaps and ArcMap are one of the first applications I learned GIS on.

Full Portland TWI (5m):
-
  - During my time as a seasonal forester for the state of Connecticut (2021-2022), I was tasked with performing analysis to show relatively wet vs dry area for timber management.
  - This is because we were shifting focus to regenerating Oak/Hickory. The end result was this map which is a 'Topographic Wetness Index'.

GSA_poster2023_final_AP:
-
  - I attended the Geological Society of America back in 2023 and presented my work of measuring Biogeography of a family of Mussels based on the fossil record through deep time.
  - I ended up winning an award for this - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7145814540545310720-5LLF

Lithologies and H. clathrata Range:
-
  - While I was atending Vanderbilt University (2023), a part of my PhD research was aimed at investigating the distribution of mollusks in relation to abiotic factors.
  - Here, I put together a map showing world ocean lithologies from a previous publication in 2015, and used this species to see if it preferred certain lithologies compared to others.

Mohegan Invasive Treatment:
- 
  - While working as a seasonal forester, I would often have to make maps like these for land managers.
  - This one is showing state forest and different areas of the lot that need to be treated for invasive species, bidded out to a external company.

New_ESRI Submision:
-
  - I attended the ESRI conference in 2024 where I presented this map.
  - Later, the data created in this map would be fundamental for future analysis in reconstructing past Biogeographies of Mytilidae throught deep time.

Vandy_CampusMap:
-
  - A campus map I made in 2025 for a course at Vanderbilt University, showing simple contours for students to follow during their lab course.

Paleomap_reconstructions:
-
  - I created this in 2024 and it would be a major step for formulating my PhD proposal.
  - Here, I used a tectonic plate model to reconstruct and rotate through time, from the Cambrien to present-day, using RStudio and Gplates connection.
-   The red dots are the fossil localities reconstructed from modern coordinates. Data is from https://paleobiodb.org/navigator
