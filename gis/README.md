Here, you'll find all my examples of maps I've made using ArcGIS/ArcPro

StoryMap:
-
- This is a storymap I helped contriube to during my time as an undergraduate at St. John's University (2014 - 2018)
- I aided with collecting of data and updating previous maps with the help of other students

Maps:
-
Full Portland TWI (5m):
-
- During my time as a seasonal forester for the state of Connecticut (2021-2022), I was tasked with performing analysis to show relatively wet vs dry area for timber management.
- This is because we were shifting focus to regenerating Oak/Hickory. The end result was this map which is a 'Topographic Wetness Index'.

GSA_poster2023_final_AP:
-
- I attended the Geological Society of America back in 2023 and presented my work of measuring Biogeography of a family of Mussels based on the fossil record through deep time.
- I ended up winning an award for this - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7145814540545310720-5LLF

Lithologies and H. clathrata Range:
-
- Made: 2023
- While I was atending Vanderbilt University, a part of my phD research was aimed at investigating the distribution of mollusks in relation to abiotic factors
- Here, I put together a map showing world ocean lithologies from a previous publication in 2015, and used this species to see if it preferred certain lithologies compared to others.

Mohegan Invasive Treatment:
- 
- While working as a seasonal forester, I would often have to make maps like these for land managers.
- This one is showing state forest and different areas of the lot that need to be treated for invasive species, bidded out to a external company.
