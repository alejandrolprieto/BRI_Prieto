Hello!
- 
My name is Alejandro Prieto and I'm applying for the Data Scientist position at the Biodiversity Research Institute.
In this repository, I've put together some example of code in R and Python. I've also added finished GIS map examples, StoryMaps and an basic application using RShiny.

If you have any questions about the example work, please feel free to contact me at alejandroLprieto04@gmail.com 
For any additional information about me, my past work experience or my skillsets, visit my website at www.sites.google.com/view/alejandro-prieto/home
